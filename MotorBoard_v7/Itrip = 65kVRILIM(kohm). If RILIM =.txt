Itrip = 65kV/RILIM(kohm). If RILIM = 33 kΩ, the DRV8871-Q1 device limits motor current to 2 A no matter how much load torque is applied

When using PWM, it typically works best to switch between driving and braking. For example, to drive a motor forward with 50% of its max RPM, IN1 = 1 and IN2 = 0 during the driving period, and IN1 = 1 and IN2 = 1 during the other period.
